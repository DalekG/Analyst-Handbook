      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The use of default or weak credentials remains one of the most common entry points for adversaries.
        As of 2025, automated "spraying" bots continuously target known manufacturer defaults and common
        password patterns. Identifying these vulnerabilities before or during an attack is vital to
        preventing unauthorized access and lateral movement.

      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>
        Adversaries leverage credential-based attacks such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Default Credential Testing:</strong> Using "admin/admin" or "root/password" on new hardware.</li>
        <li><strong>Password Spraying:</strong> Testing common passwords (e.g., "Company2025!") against many accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> Systematically attempting to guess passwords on exposed services.</li>
        <li><strong>IoT Exploitation:</strong> Targeting embedded devices that lack robust password enforcement.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Investigation Workflow</h2>

      <h4>Identify Where Detected</h4>
      <h4>What system/service is involved?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critical Server:</strong> (DC, DB, Web) Immediate remediation required.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Device:</strong> (Router, Switch, Firewall) High priority; risk of traffic interception.</li>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Check the data sensitivity and exposure level.</li>
        <li><strong>IoT/Embedded Device:</strong> Often overlooked; can be used as a persistent foothold.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How was it detected?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Successful login with a known default credential (via SIEM/EDR).</li>
        <li>Vulnerability scan finding (e.g., Nessus, Qualys).</li>
        <li>Internal password audit or "cracking" exercise.</li>
        <li>Failed attack attempt that revealed the use of a default credential in the logs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Assess Exposure and Risk</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Is the system internet-facing?</strong> If <strong>Yes</strong>, this is a CRITICAL finding requiring immediate change.</li>
        <li><strong>What level of access is provided?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Administrative/Root access: Critical risk.</li>
            <li>User-level access: Serious risk.</li>
            <li>Read-only access: Moderate concern; still requires remediation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> How long has this been in use? Review logs for unauthorized access over the last 90 days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Has the Credential Been Abused?</h4>
      <h4>Review Authentication Logs:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify unusual login times, sources (IPs), or geolocations.</li>
        <li>Look for a pattern of multiple failed attempts followed by a single success.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Review System Activity:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Check for unauthorized configuration changes.</li>
        <li>Analyze file or database access logs for data staging.</li>
        <li>Look for unauthorized software or script installations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Findings:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes (Signs of Abuse):</strong> <strong>Escalate immediately</strong> to the Account Compromise workflow. Assume the system is compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>No (No signs of abuse):</strong> Proceed to Immediate Remediation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Immediate Remediation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Change the credential immediately</strong> to a unique, complex password or secret.</li>
        <li>Force a logout of all active sessions associated with the account.</li>
        <li>Review and harden the security configuration (e.g., disable unused services).</li>
        <li>Document the specific default/weak credential found for reporting.</li>
        <li>Check all other systems from the same vendor/model for identical defaults.</li>
        <li>If the password was user-created, update the Password Policy to enforce complexity.</li>
      </ul>
