      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Privileged access outside of standard business hours is a high-risk indicator. While often
        associated with emergency maintenance or on-call duties, it is also a primary signature
        of credential compromise, as adversaries often operate during low-staffing periods to
        evade detection and manual intervention.

      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>
        Adversaries leverage administrative credentials during "quiet" hours to perform high-impact
        actions with a lower risk of being noticed by the account owner. Common activities include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mass Data Staging:</strong> Moving large volumes of data to exfiltration points.</li>
        <li><strong>System Reconfiguration:</strong> Disabling security agents or modifying firewall rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Creating new administrative accounts or backdoors.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware Deployment:</strong> Executing encryption routines when IT staff response is delayed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Investigation Workflow</h2>

      <h3>Identify Access Details</h3>
      <h4>Specific account involved:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Named Administrator:</strong> Facilitates direct contact and verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Generic Admin Account:</strong> Identify the specific individual currently checked out or using the account via PAM logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Account:</strong> <strong>High Concern:</strong> Service accounts should typically not have interactive (RDP/SSH) login capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Break-Glass Account:</strong> Verify if an official emergency has been declared.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Time of access:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Late Evening:</strong> Possible legitimate overtime; check for active project deadlines.</li>
        <li><strong>Middle of Night (2-5 AM):</strong> High suspicion; typical "window of opportunity" for attackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekend/Holiday:</strong> Verify against the on-call rotation or pre-approved maintenance windows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Identify Access Source and Method</h3>
      <h4>Source location:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate VPN:</strong> More likely legitimate; verify the VPN session IP and MFA status.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Internet:</strong> High concern; indicates bypass of standard secure access gateways.</li>
        <li><strong>Known Admin Workstation:</strong> Lower concern; verify the host's physical location.</li>
        <li><strong>Unknown System:</strong> Investigate immediately as a potential "bring your own device" (BYOD) or rogue host.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign Geolocation:</strong> Very high concern unless the administrator is on verified international travel.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Access method:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard Protocols (RDP/SSH):</strong> Verify if this matches the user's typical remote management style.</li>
        <li><strong>Unusual Protocols:</strong> (e.g., PowerShell Remoting from a new host) Investigate for "Living-off-the-Land" tactics.</li>
        <li><strong>Brute Force Pattern:</strong> Multiple failed attempts followed by a success suggests a credential compromise event.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Verify Legitimacy</h3>
      <h4>Contact Account Owner Directly:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact via phone or secure IM (<strong>Do not use email</strong>, as the account may be compromised).</li>
        <li>Confirm they are currently working and have accessed the specific target system.</li>
        <li>Inquire about the specific business purpose of the activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Check for Authorization:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Review Change Management (CM) tickets or scheduled maintenance windows.</li>
        <li>Verify the administrator's status on the official On-Call schedule.</li>
        <li>Check for documented emergency manager approvals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Is Access Authorized?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Yes (Verified with owner or approved change):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Monitor the session activity to ensure it stays within the stated scope.</li>
            <li>Document the authorization details and ticket number.</li>
            <li>Close the alert once the work is confirmed complete.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cannot Verify (User unresponsive):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Request Senior Analyst review and begin technical behavior analysis.</li>
            <li>Attempt alternate contact methods (e.g., calling their manager).</li>
            <li>Prepare to disable the account if any destructive or suspicious actions are observed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No (User denies access or no authorization found):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Disable the account immediately.</strong></li>
            <li>Terminate all active sessions for the user globally.</li>
            <li>Execute the <strong>Account Compromise Workflow</strong>.</li>
            <li>Perform a full audit of all actions taken during the session.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
